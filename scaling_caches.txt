Cache is just like a dattabase, hence scaling technique for a cache like Redis is similar to a regular database.

--> Vertical Scaling -> Make your cache bigger to handle new data/load

--> Horizontal Scaling - Replica (Scaling Reads) -> Some data replicated across multiple nodes so that reads could scale

--> Horizontal Scaling - Sharding(Scaling writes) -> Data partitioned across multiple shards so that writes could scale
                                                  -> Each shard can have a replica
                                                  -> Shards are mutually exclusive
